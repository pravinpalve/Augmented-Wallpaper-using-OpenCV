# Augmented-Wallpaper-using-OpenCV

This task utilizes fundamental concepts in Computer Vision (CV) to demonstrate basic Augmented Reality (AR) applications. We employ AR markers developed by the University of CÂ´ordoba, known as ArUco markers, to overlay a Display Image (DI) onto a wall using an ArUco marker in the Source Image (SI) while matching perspectives and scaling.

## Source Images
This folder contains all the input images with ArUco markers on which we want to project our display image.

## Display Image
This image is projected on ArUco markers in source images.

## Report
In the attached report, I have explained the underlying logic of the functions used and showcased final images displaying actual results.
