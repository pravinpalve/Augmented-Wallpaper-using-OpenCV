# Augmented-Wallpaper-using-OpenCV

This task utilizes fundamental concepts in Computer Vision (CV) to demonstrate basic Augmented Reality (AR) applications. We employ AR markers developed by the University of CÂ´ordoba, known as ArUco markers, to overlay a Display Image (DI) onto a wall using an ArUco marker in the Source Image (SI) while matching perspectives and scaling.

In the attached report, I have explained the underlying logic of the functions used and showcased final images displaying actual results.
